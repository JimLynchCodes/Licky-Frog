# Licky-Frog
A website for the Licky Frog Computer game.

This game is supposed to be a spinoff / clone of the crazy-fun Html5 game http://agar.io/ .

The specs and ideas for this game are in the Google Drive folder "Licky-Frog".

I'm still debating whether we should use pure AngularJS, pure PhaserJS, or some hybrid of the two.

In any case, the live version (basically, what the yeoman generator spit out) can be viewed here: http://jimtheman.github.io/Licky-Frog/#/
